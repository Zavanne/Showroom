Problem: Online Shop Order Fulfillment

You are tasked with developing a program to streamline the order fulfillment process for an online shop. 
The shop receives orders for various products, and your program should handle the following functionalities:

Inventory Management: Keep track of the available quantity of each product in the inventory. 
                      When an order is placed, ensure that there is sufficient stock to fulfill the order.

Order Processing: Process the orders as they come in. Update the inventory quantity accordingly and
                  generate a confirmation email to the customer.

Stock Alerts: Monitor the inventory levels and generate alerts when the quantity of a product falls 
              below a specified threshold. The alerts should provide the product name and the current 
              quantity in stock.

Sales Analytics: Generate sales reports to track the performance of products. This report should include
                 information such as the total sales revenue, the best-selling products, and the 
                 least-selling products.
