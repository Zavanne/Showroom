    Me: Ok, I think I went I little too ambitious on this test. let's start with  level 4 questions that come
    from real problems. Let's not do manufacturing lines just yet. :)

    OpenAI: Absolutely! Let's start with a level 4 problem derived from a real-world scenario.

    Problem: Online Shop Order Fulfillment

    You are tasked with developing a program to streamline the order fulfillment process for an online shop.
    The shop receives orders for various products, and your program should handle the following functionali
    ties: Inventory Management: Keep track of the available quantity of each product in the inventory. When 
    an order is placed, ensure that there is sufficient stock to fulfill the order.

    Order Processing: 

    Process the orders as they come in. Update the inventory quantity accordingly and generate a confirmation
    email to the customer. Stock Alerts: Monitor the inventory levels and generate alerts when the quantity 
    of a product falls below a specified threshold. The alerts should provide the product name and the current 
    quantity in stock.

    Sales Analytics: 

    Generate sales reports to track the performance of products. This report should include information such
    as the total sales revenue, the best-selling products, and the least-selling products.

    Level: 4/5

    Your task is to design and implement a program that incorporates the functionalities mentioned above to
    streamline the order fulfillment process for the online shop. You can use any programming language of 
    your choice and consider using appropriate data structures and algorithms to handle the operations 
    efficiently.
